<p>WBI Team 461 had a very successful season in 2007. We attended the St. Louis Regional last year, and won the Engineering Inspiration award, that allowed us to travel to Nationals in Atlanta once again. We also attended our local regional, the Boilermaker Regional where we got 2nd place on an alliance with our sister team from Harrison High School, 1747 HBR. At Atlanta, we ended our season in the top 20 out over 80 teams in the Gallileo division. At the Indiana Robotics Regional in July, we went on to the elimination round with a drive team that had never driven the robot before.</p>
