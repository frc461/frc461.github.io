<h3>2009 season</h3>
<br>
<p>WBI celebrated a decade of FIRST® Robotics tradition. Starting off the season at the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, OH, team 461 won the Judge's Award for its support of other teams with both hardware and software and was seeded 13th at the end of qualification rounds. At the Boilermaker Regional, suffering from technical issues, the team was seeded 31st, but was selected by the second seed alliance of team 45, the Technokats, and team 234, Cyberblue. The alliance made it to the finals, being narrowly defeated in a tiebreaker match by a margin of three points. For its organization of alumni reunion, team 461 received a Judge's Award. At the FIRST® Championship event in Atlanta, GA, team 461 made a strong showing, going 6-1 and was seeded 10th at the end of qualification rounds.</p>
