    2005 was WBI's sixth season. The team grew even more this year, and the focus was on having a great robot and expanding out into the community. WBI served as a mentor team this year to Teams 1555 at North White High School, Team Pulse, and 1646 at Lafayette Jefferson High School, Team Boiler Precision Guessworks. Our partnerships involved sending students and advisors to work with the teams at their schools as well as promoting the FIRSTÂ® experience. During 2005, WBI also assisted with the operation and setup of the Boilermaker Regional in West Lafayette, Indiana, as well as competing in it. At the Boilermaker Regional, WBI received the Website Design award. WBI also competed in the Motorola Midwest Regional, where the team won the Team Spirit Award for BOSS (Boiler Online Scouting System), an online database of scouting information on all of the teams at the regional. (Scouting data can be downloaded for the Boilermaker Regional, the Motorola Midwest Regional, and the Championship Event in Curie division can be found at http://www.thebluealliance.com/team/461/2005.) WBI also attended the Championship Event in Atlanta, Georgia.
