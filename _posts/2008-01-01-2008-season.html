<h3>2008 season</h3>
<br>
<p>WBI competed in the Boilermaker Regional, won 2nd place and fought a close final round and won the Xerox Creativity Award. In the Great Lakes Regional in Ypsilanti, MI, technical problems caused many losses. Not to be discouraged, the team began to work on improvements for the Atlanta Championship. At Atlanta, in many energy packed matches, WBI ended in the upper half of the Archimedes Division. Unfortunately, WBI was not selected to participate as part of an alliance in the elmination rounds.</p>
