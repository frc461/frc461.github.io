<h3>2004 season</h3>
<br>
<p>WBI's success in its fifth season was the culmination of hard work and determination. There were 46 students from local high schools and 17 Purdue University advisors. We attended the Great Lakes Regional in Ypsilanti, Michigan, where WBI placed 22nd overall and was chosen by WildStang (#111), the first seed team, for the finals. WBI was awarded the Leadership in Control Award in honor of our programming efforts. At the Motorola Midwest Regional in Evanston, Illinois, we won the award for Website Design. We were also chosen as the first pick of sixth seed CFHS Robotics (#525) in elimination rounds. At the National Competition, the WBI alliance was 2nd overall in the Curie division, and 5th in the nation. At the 2004 Indiana Robotics Invitational, WBI won the Animation Award for a fantastic animation made within only a day.  </p>
