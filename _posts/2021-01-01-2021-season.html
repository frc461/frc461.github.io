  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>In an unprecedented decision, FIRST decided that there would not be a new game challenge for the 2021 season due to the ongoing global pandemic. Team 461 was challenged to compete in a series of at home challenges that pushed their 2020 season robot to the test both in driver skill and technical automation. Concurrently, the team also competed in a new game design task in which they earned the Concept award as well as in an innovation challenge where they were semifinalists for their cube device aimed to improve mental health. As a finale to the season, Team 461 was honored with a State level Chairman’s award for their commitment to changing the culture in Indiana.</p>
