<h3>2015 season</h3>
<br>
<p>In our sixteenth season we went through numerous iterations of robot design, improving our lift with each one. Through all the changes and challenges Rowdy 16 was debuted. We made it all the way to third place at the Indianapolis District, where we were honored to win the Engineering Inspiration for our work with the Boy Scouts of America. We were also honored to win the Judges Award at State.</p>
