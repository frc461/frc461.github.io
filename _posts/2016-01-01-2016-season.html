<h3>2016 season</h3>
<br>
<p>Our 17th season was a blast with FIRST Stronghold. Rowdy 17 stormed our competitions - winning Finalist and Engineering Inspiration at the Walker-Warren District. We were also honored to qualify for the FIRST Championship. We had a great time in St. Louis and were excited to meet cool teams from around the world!</p>
