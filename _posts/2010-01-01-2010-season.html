Most notably, the team repeated history by winning the Best Website Award at the Buckeye Regional, Boilermaker Regional, and the FIRSTÂ® Championship, as it had done in the 2006 competition season. The team was also awarded the Engineering Inspiration Award at the Boilermaker Regional, and was selected to the elimination bracket at the Buckeye Regional.</p>
