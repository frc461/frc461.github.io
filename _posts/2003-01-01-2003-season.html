<p>In its 4th season, WBI attended two regional competitions, the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland and the Midwest Regional in Chicago. The team also attended the National Competition, held in Houston, Texas. The team had a successful season, brought home 3rd place in the Animation competition, and finished 8th place overall at the Buckeye Regional. In Chicago, WBI was honored with the Regional Chairmans Award (see the Public Relations page and the 2003 Chairman's Award page). One of only 23 teams nationally to win this prestigious award, WBI then had the opportunity to submit an entry into the National Chairmans Award Competition. </p>
