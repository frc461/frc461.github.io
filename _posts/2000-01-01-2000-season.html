<h3>2000 season</h3>
<br>
<p>In January of 2000, the team, Westside Boiler Invasion 461 (WBI 461), tackled the challenge of designing a robot. The robot was named Rowdy Pete 1, reflecting Purdue's great influence on WBI 461. In the first year, Westside Boiler Invasion was comprised of 18 high school students from West Lafayette and Harrison High Schools and 12 Purdue University students. The team was unique in the fact that it was completely student run. The team competed in the Motorola Midwest Regional, taking home the Rookie All-Star award. But the memories and hard work didn't stop there. At that time, the team did not have enough funds to buy uniforms (the team tie-dyed their own shirts, earning the nickname "Team Sherbet"), let alone attend the National Championship, which is the culminating event of the season. The advisors knew the great benefit of competing at nationals and did not want to let this opportunity pass by. Thus, everything possible was done to raise money: begging companies, getting donations from alumni, and even getting another team (Truck Town Terror #68, now called Truck Town Thunder) to pay for the hotel. The gracious professionalism paid to WBI 461 was immeasurable. All the effort put forth by the team paid off when Westside Boiler Invasion qualified for nationals at Motorola. Our team also set its precedent of being extremely spirited. Even though no awards were won at nationals, the fact that the team got there was enough to make it among the best experiences of everyone on the team. </p>
