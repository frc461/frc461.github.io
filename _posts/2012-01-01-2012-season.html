<p>In our 2012 season and thirteenth year as a team, WBI aimed for excellence with Rowdy 13. We attended the Boilermaker Regional and were awarded the Gracious Professionalism Award. We also attended the Washington DC Regional where we had the honor of winning the Chariman's Award, allowing us to travel to the World Championships in Saint Louis.</p>
