<p>In our 19th season, we reached new levels in FIRST PowerUp. With our trusty friend Rowdy Pete XIX, we competed in three events, St. Joseph District, Tippecanoe District, and Indiana State Championship. At St. Joseph, we were a part of the 7th seeded alliance alongside our fellow PFP team, 4272, and Michigan team 4004. During the Tippecanoe District event, we ranked 12th, were a part of the 6th seeded alliance with 5304 and 1646. Additionally, we won Engineering Inspiration, the second-most prestigious award in FIRST which qualified us for state championships automatically. At state, we went to semi-finals with our 5th seeded alliance partners 829 and 3176 and won gracious professionalism.</p>
