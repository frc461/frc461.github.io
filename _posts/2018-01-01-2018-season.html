  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>In our 19th season, our journey through FIRST PowerUp heralded new heights of achievement and camaraderie. Guided by our steadfast companion, Rowdy Pete XIX, we traversed three notable events: the St. Joseph District, the Tippecanoe District, and the Indiana State Championship, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for growth.</p>
  <p>At the St. Joseph District, we collaborated as part of the 7th seeded alliance, joining forces with our esteemed partners from PFP team 4272 and Michigan team 4004. This alliance exemplified the power of teamwork and collaboration in the pursuit of success on the competitive stage.</p>
  <p>During the Tippecanoe District event, we showcased our resilience and skill, securing a commendable 12th ranking and earning a spot in the 6th seeded alliance alongside teams 5304 and 1646. Notably, our performance also earned us the prestigious Engineering Inspiration Award, a testament to our commitment to innovation and inspiration within the FIRST community, automatically qualifying us for the state championships.</p>
  <p>At the state level, we continued to demonstrate our competitive prowess, advancing to the semi-finals with our allies from the 5th seeded alliance, teams 829 and 3176. Additionally, our embodiment of the FIRST values was recognized with the gracious professionalism award, underscoring our dedication to sportsmanship and mutual respect both on and off the field.</p>
  <p>Throughout this remarkable season, our team's journey was defined by collaboration, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, setting the stage for even greater achievements in the seasons to come.</p>
