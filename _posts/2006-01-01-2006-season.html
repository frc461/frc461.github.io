<h3>2006 season</h3>
<br>
<p>The 2006 season was WBI's seventh. Like the previous year, we mentored a rookie team, Team 1747 at Harrison High School, Team Harrison Boiler Robotics. WBI attended the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, Ohio, as well as the Boilermaker Regional in West Lafayette, Indiana. The team also competed at the Championship Event in Atlanta, Georgia. At the Buckeye Regional, Team 461 was honored with the Website Award as well as the Engineering Inspiration Award, the second most prestigious award in FIRSTÂ®. WBI also finished the regional as the runner-up, along with our allies Team 1018, Pike Robo-Devils, and Team 141, the Wo-Bots. WBI mentor Steve Florence was honored with the Regional Woodie Flowers Award. At the Boilermaker Regional, WBI won the Website Award and the Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers Entrepreneurship Award. WBI competed from April 27-29, 2006, in the Championship Event, held in Atlanta at the Georgia Dome. At the Championship Event, WBI won the Website Award, a feat we are extremely proud of.</p>
