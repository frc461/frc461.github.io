<p>In our fourteenth year as a team, WBI aimed high in 2013 with Rowdy 14. We attended the Boilermaker Regional and managed to advance as far as the semi-finals after overcoming several robot issues throughout the competition. We later attended the Buckeye Regional where we had the honor of seeding 8th, allowing WBI to be a team drafting an alliance for the first time in many years.</p>
