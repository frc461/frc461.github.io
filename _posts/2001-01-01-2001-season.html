    In 2001, new students were brought on the team, raised the numbers to 22 high school students from West Lafayette, Harrison, and Jefferson high schools, 18 Purdue students, 2 high school teachers, and 3 industry professionals. More of the new advisors had been on teams in high school themselves, and the diversity and experience brought to WBI became a huge asset to the team. Funding improved and the team was able to attend the Motorola Midwest Regional and the National Championship. The team also went to several post-national competitions, the Indiana Robotics Invitational (IRI) and the Ford Sweet Repeat (FSR). The team took home the Daimler Chrysler Spirit Award from the Motorola Regional and the Teamwork Award from the IRI. The season was capped off by winning both the entire tournament and the Girls Championship at the Ford Sweet Repeat (FSR).
