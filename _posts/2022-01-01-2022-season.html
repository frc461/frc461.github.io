  <h3>Summary:</h3>
  <p>For the 2022 FRC season, Team 461 aimed to take on the new Rapid React challenge after having their 2020 and 2021 competition seasons cut short. Going into their first competition of the season, they looked to be a top contender at the Kokomo District Event. Completing the first traversal climb in the state of Indiana set the bar high as they advanced in the rankings; ultimately having a semifinal exit. Topping off this exciting return to competition, Westside was honored with the Chairman’s Award and a renewed determination. Their second event of the season at the Tippecanoe District Event saw them improve and get selected second overall with a quarterfinal finish. At the Indiana State Championship, Team 461 elected to captain an alliance from the 7th seed pulling off an upset over a very tough number two alliance. In the semifinals, a fall during the endgame and a missed cycle signaled the end of a very exciting season.</p>
